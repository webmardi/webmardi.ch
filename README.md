### ‚ö†Ô∏è Linters

Thanks to [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), our linters are automatically fired when a commit is attempted. To fire them manually:

```bash
# Lint JavaScript
bun run lint:js
```

## Contribute

The project is using the **Gitflow workflow**. It defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.
