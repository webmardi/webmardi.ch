## Overview

Webmardi is a static generated website based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

- **Language:** Uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the main programming language. üë®‚Äçüè´ Feel free to use the [TypeScript CheatSheet](https://typescript-cheatsheet.vercel.app/)
- **CSS-in-JS:** Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [Twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) for styling.
- **Deployment:** Uses [Infomaniak](https://infomaniak.com/) for hosting, deployed using a Github action.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Linters

Thanks to [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), our linters are automatically fired when a commit is attempted. To fire them manually:

```bash
# Lint JavaScript
yarn lint:js
```

## Contribute

The project is using the **Gitflow workflow**. It defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.
